# Homebrew defaults when running locally (outside Docker):
# - Host: localhost

# Optional (advanced): Use a UNIX socket inside the container by mounting
# your host Postgres socket directory (e.g., /opt/homebrew/var/run/postgresql)
# into the container and set PGHOST to that path (container side):
# PGHOST=/var/run/postgresql
